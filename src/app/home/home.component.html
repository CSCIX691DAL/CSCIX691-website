        Thank you for visiting the website for Dalhousie's Community Outreach class.  This class provides students with
        invaluable experience working with real-world projects and actual clients to ensure the clients' needs are met.  This
        experience is all gained through group work and in-class guidance that provides students with a safe first experience
        with actual projects.

      <p class="card-text">
        In this class, students are placed in groups that consist of second, third and fourth year students, distributed evenly
        to ensure a fair and productive mix of skill, learning and leadership development.  These groups are overseen and
        mentored by exceptional and experienced Teaching Assistants that will ensure both that the students meet the learning
        outcomes and that the clients leave happy with a product that will be valuable to them. Student groups will
        communicate directly with the client in order to fully understand client expectations, desired features and receive
        feedback and provide deliverables at specified increments.  The students themselves will manage the deliverables and
        expectations and present the final product at the end of the designated semester.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        The course welcomes any client project that requires a development component.  We are constantly accepting new
        project applications and encourage you to view past completed project <a href="/projects">here</a>.  If you think you have
        a project that would match the courses students well, please feel free to complete a
